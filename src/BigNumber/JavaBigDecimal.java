/**
 * Java's BigDecimal class can handle arbitrary-precision signed decimal
 * numbers. Let's test your knowledge of them!
 * 
 * Given an array, , of real number strings, sort them in descending order â€” but
 * wait, there's more! Each number must be printed in the exact same format as
 * it was read from stdin, meaning that is printed as , and is printed as . If
 * two numbers represent numerically equivalent values (e.g., ), then they must
 * be listed in the same order as they were received as input).
 * 
 * Complete the code in the unlocked section of the editor below. You must
 * rearrange array 's elements according to the instructions above.
 * 
 * Input Format
 * 
 * The first line consists of a single integer, , denoting the number of integer
 * strings.
 * Each line of the subsequent lines contains a real number denoting the value
 * of .
 * 
 * Constraints
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 200
 * Each s[i] has at most 300 digits
 * 
 * Each has at most digits.
 * Output Format
 * 
 * Locked stub code in the editor will print the contents of array to stdout.
 * You are only responsible for reordering the array's elements.
 * 
 * Sample Input
 * 
 * 9
 * -100
 * 50
 * 0
 * 56.6
 * 90
 * 0.12
 * .12
 * 02.34
 * 000.000
 * Sample Output
 * 
 * 90
 * 56.6
 * 50
 * 02.34
 * 0.12
 * .12
 * 0
 * 000.000
 * -100
